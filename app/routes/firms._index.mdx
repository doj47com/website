Donald Trump's second administration finds him threatening law firms with significant penalties unless they give him free legal services.

A pattern has emerged, where Trump issues an executive order where he:

- revokes the security clearances of the lawyers at the firm
- forbids them from entering buildings operated by the US government
- orders the US government to cancel any contracts with them. 

You know what buildings are operated by the US government? Courthouses.

You know what job is hard to do if you can't enter a courthouse? Lawyerin'.

Writing so many executive orders can be tiring, so Trump's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has helped out on his behalf, writing [scary letters to 20 law firms](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-acting-chair-andrea-lucas-sends-letters-20-law-firms-requesting-information-about-dei).

Some law firms have resisted this in court, which seems like a sensible thing to do, given that they are, in fact, lawyers.

Others have acquiesced, confessed their fault, and offered tens of millions of dollars in free legal work to advance Trump's agenda.
