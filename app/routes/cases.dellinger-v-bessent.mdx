# Background

Hampton Dellinger was appointed Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel by Joe Biden. He was sworn in on March 6, 2024.

Donald Trump fired him on February 7, 2025. The firing was in violation of the law, which provides that a special counsel can only be fired due to "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."

Dellinger launched a lawsuit to overturn the firing.

# Result

Dellinger ultimately dropped his lawsuit, and accepted his dismissal.
