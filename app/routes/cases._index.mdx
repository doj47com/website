Trump is attempting to fundamentally rewrite how the law is applied in America.

# Birthright citizenship

Trump issues an executive order purporting to upend how birthright citizenship works in the US. Several entities sued.

- [State of Washington v Trump](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69561931/state-of-washington-v-trump/)

# Corruption
- [United States v. Adams](/cases/adams): can the US make quid pro quo deals with politicians to drop criminal charges in exchange for political favours?

# Deportations
- [Abrego Garcia v. Noem](/cases/abrego-garcia): when the US illegally deports a man to El Salvador in violation of a prior court order, must they at least try to get him back?
- [J.G.G. v Trump](/cases/jgg-v-trump): should people be permitted the opportunity to object before being blackbagged to a foreign terrorism prison?

# Freedom of the press

- [Associated Press v Budowich](cases/ap-v-budowich): can the president punish the press if they don't report the way he likes?

# Law firm intimidation

_See also [law firms in the second Trump administration](/firms)._

Trump issued executive orders against several law firms, often based on personal vendettas based on how their current or previous employees have treated him.

Many law firms capitulated. Some resisted:

- [Susman Godfrey](/cases/susman-godfrey-v-president)
- [WilmerHale](/cases/wilmerhale-v-president)
- [Jenner & Block](/cases/jenner-block-v-doj)
- [Perkins Coie](/cases/perkins-coie-v-doj)

# Cases I'm not yet tracking

## Should track

- [Mahmoud Khalil v Joyce](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69757814/khalil-v-joyce/): can the US government deport green card holders for free speech?
- [Ozturk v Hyde](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69845539/ozturk-v-hyde/): can the US government deport green card holders for free speech?
## Might track

These are also interesting cases, but feel less important than the others, and I have limited time.

- [Climate United Fund v Citibank](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69718818/climate-united-fund-v-citibank-na/)
  - the [DOJ behaved poorly](https://bsky.app/profile/kathryntewson.bsky.social/post/3lk745f6ma22a)
  - [Denise Cheung resigned](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/denise-cheung-us-attorneys-office-washington-020363) rather than gin up criminal charges
- [AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v US Dept of State](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69627654/aids-vaccine-advocacy-coalition-v-united-states-department-of-state/): can the president just not pay people for work authorized by Congress and already done?
- [Doe v Office of Personnel Management](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69582338/doe-v-office-of-personnel-management/): the underlying case isn't that interesting. However, there's a pending motion for sanctions against the government. One of the gov lawyers has since quit DOJ and is now on the Abrego Garcia case. Maybe that's just random noise, but maybe there's something interesting there.
- [State of Maine v USDA](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69853711/state-of-maine-v-united-states-department-of-agriculture/): if the governor of Maine is mean to the president, can he take food from the mouths of Maine's schoolkids?
- [National Treasury Employees Union v Vought](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624423/national-treasury-employees-union-v-vought/): can the president unilaterally dismantle an agency created by Congress?
  - noteworthy for [comments the judge made in her preliminary injunction order](https://bsky.app/profile/dnelsonorl.bsky.social/post/3llhtcwvpu22n)
