Trump is attempting to fundamentally rewrite how the law is applied in America.

# Birthright Citizenship


# Corruption
- [United States v. Adams](/cases/adams): can the US make quid pro quo deals with politicians to drop criminal charges in exchange for political favours?

# Deportations
- [Abrego Garcia v. Noem](/cases/abrego-garcia): when the US illegally deports a man to El Salvador in violation of a prior court order, must they at least try to get him back?
- [J.G.G. v Trump](/cases/jgg-v-trump): should people be permitted the opportunity to object before being blackbagged to a foreign terrorism prison?

# Freedom of the Press

- [Associated Press v Budowich](cases/ap-v-budowich): can the president punish the press if they don't report the way he likes?

# Cases I'd like to start tracking but haven't yet

- [Mahmoud Khalil v Joyce](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69757814/khalil-v-joyce/): can the US government deport green card holders for free speech?
- [Ozturk v Hyde](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69845539/ozturk-v-hyde/): can the US government deport green card holders for free speech?
- [State of Washington v Trump](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69561931/state-of-washington-v-trump/): are US citizens _really_ US citizens?
- The law firm lawsuits
  - [Susman Godfrey](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69881953/susman-godfrey-llp-v-executive-office-of-the-president/)
  - [WilmerHale](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69807328/wilmer-cutler-pickering-hale-and-dorr-llp-v-executive-office-of-the/)
  - [Jenner & Block](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69807126/jenner-block-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/)
  - [Perkins Coie](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69725919/perkins-coie-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/)

# Cases maybe worth tracking

These are also interesting cases, but feel less important than the others, and I have limited time.

- [Climate United Fund v Citibank](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69718818/climate-united-fund-v-citibank-na/)
  - the [DOJ behaved poorly](https://bsky.app/profile/kathryntewson.bsky.social/post/3lk745f6ma22a)
  - [Denise Cheung resigned](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/denise-cheung-us-attorneys-office-washington-020363) rather than gin up criminal charges
- [AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v US Dept of State](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69627654/aids-vaccine-advocacy-coalition-v-united-states-department-of-state/): can the president just not pay people for work authorized by Congress and already done?
- [Doe v Office of Personnel Management](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69582338/doe-v-office-of-personnel-management/): the underlying case isn't that interesting. However, there's a pending motion for sanctions against the government. One of the gov lawyers has since quit DOJ and is now on the Abrego Garcia case. Maybe that's just random noise, but maybe there's something interesting there.
- [State of Maine v USDA](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69853711/state-of-maine-v-united-states-department-of-agriculture/): if the governor of Maine is mean to the president, can he take food from the mouths of Maine's schoolkids?
- [National Treasury Employees Union v Vought](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624423/national-treasury-employees-union-v-vought/): can the president unilaterally dismantle an agency created by Congress?
  - noteworthy for [comments the judge made in her preliminary injunction order](https://bsky.app/profile/dnelsonorl.bsky.social/post/3llhtcwvpu22n)
