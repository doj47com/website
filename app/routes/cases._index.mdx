# Lawsuits during Trump's second presidency

- [Abrego Garcia v. Noem](/cases/abrego-garcia): when the US illegally deports a man to El Salvador in violation of a prior court order, must they at least try to get him back?
- [J.G.G. v Trump](/cases/jgg-v-trump): should people be permitted the opportunity to object before being blackbagged to a foreign terrorism prison?
- [United States v. Adams](/cases/adams): can the US make quid pro quo deals with politicians to drop criminal charges in exchange for political favours?
