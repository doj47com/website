# United States v. Adams

## Court dockets

- [United States v. Adams (1:24-cr-00556)](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69197933/united-states-v-adams/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc): initial indictment

## Background

The Biden administration indicted Eric Adams, the mayor of New York. They alleged he accepted bribes from the Turkish government.

The Trump administration offered to drop the charges without prejudice, meaning that the charges could be brought again in the future if the US government changed its mind.

At about the same time, Adams agreed to change New York's policies to co-operate more closely with the US government.

### The question

Can the government use the carrot of dropping criminal charges as a quid pro quo to obtain favours from politicians?

### Why it's fucked up

Several DOJ prosecutors resigned rather than go along with the scheme to extort Adams.

### Result

The judge denied the government's request to drop the charges without prejudice.

The charges were dropped with prejudice. Whether Adams continues to do the things he professed he would do remains to be seen.
