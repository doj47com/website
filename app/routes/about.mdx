# About

DOJ47.com is a personal project by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cldellow.com">@cldellow.com</a>.

This site contains my opinions. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not even American. Take with a grain of salt.

That said, I try to link to source documents where possible. Form your own opinions.

## How can I help?

Flag interesting things to me on Bluesky.

Or contribute improvements directly on the [doj47com/website GitHub project](https://github.com/doj47com/website).

## Can I donate to you?

This site costs very little to run, no donations are needed.

However, much of the content on this site is sourced from people who you _can_ support! (If your name should be on this, feel free to DM/email me.)
