# About

DOJ47.com is a personal project by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cldellow.com">@cldellow.com</a>.

The US is... going through some stuff right now. The rest of the world, too. Luckily, there are many legal commentators on Bluesky doing an excellent job of documenting and explaining it. But those posts are ephemeral, quickly buried in the timeline. DOJ47.com tries to collect and organize them.

I'm not a lawyer. I'm not even American! Take this site with a grain of salt -- it's like a journal, containing my in-the-moment thoughts as Donald Trump's second presidency unfolds.

That said, I try to link to source documents where possible. Form your own opinions.

## How can I help?
