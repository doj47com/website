# About

DOJ47.com is a personal project by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cldellow.com">@cldellow.com</a>.

In Canada, if you know the name of a Supreme Court judge, [something has gone horribly wrong](https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/resources/professional-regulation/scc-judge-russell-brown-retiring-immediately-after-allegations-about-behaviour-at-arizona-resort/376677). In the US it seems like things go horribly wrong often enough that people may as well have judicial trading cards. "I'll trade you a Kavanaugh rookie card for a mint condition Judge Ho 2025 minor league one."

Think of this like a journal. I'm writing it down so I can look back in 20 years and remember how shocking and sweeping the whole thing seemed while it was unfolding.

This site contains my opinions. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not even American. Take with a grain of salt.

That said, I try to link to source documents where possible. Form your own opinions.
