# Abrego Garcia v. Noem

## Court dockets

- [Abrego Garcia v Noem (8:25-cv-00951)](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/): initial complaint
- [25-1345](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69847836/kilmar-abrego-garcia-v-kristi-noem/): government appeal to 4th circuit
- [24A949](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24a949.html): government appeal to Supreme Court

## Background

The US government deported a man to an [El Salvadoran prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Confinement_Center), claiming he was an MS13 gang member. The man was protected by a 2019 court order that held he could not be deported to El Salvador.

### The question
Must the government at least try to get the man back from prison?

### Why it's fucked up
The government did not give the man a chance to protest his removal. The government admits his removal was illegal. As of April 12, they do not appear to have even attempted to retrieve the man. They do not seem concerned by this result.
