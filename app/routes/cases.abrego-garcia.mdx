# Court dockets

- [Abrego Garcia v Noem (8:25-cv-00951)](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/): initial complaint
- [25-1345](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69847836/kilmar-abrego-garcia-v-kristi-noem/): government appeal to 4th circuit
- [24A949](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24a949.html): government appeal to Supreme Court

# Background

The US government deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to an [El Salvadoran prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Confinement_Center), claiming he was an MS13 gang member. The man was protected by a 2019 court order that held he could not be deported to El Salvador.

## The question

Must the government at least try to get the man back from prison?

## Why it's fucked up

The government's stance seems to be that anyone who they choose to imprison in El Salvador's Terror Confinement Center is blackholed forever.

Thus, even if the government admits (as they do here) that their action was illegal, it's too late.

## Possible wrinkle

Unlike most people that the US is incarcerating in El Salvador, Abrego Garcia is himself an El Salvadoran citizen.
