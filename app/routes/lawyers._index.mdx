# Lawyers in the second Trump administration

Trump's second term presents unique opportunities for lawyers to debase themselves, or, in some cases, to demonstrate their principles.

## Government lawyers

### August Flentje

[August Flentje](https://www.linkedin.com/in/august-flentje-59418ba7/), Deputy Director of Immigration Litigation (26 years at DOJ) supervised Erez Reuveni.

[ABC News reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-places-attorney-leave-after-struggling-maryland-migrant/story?id=120526466) that he was suspended for "failure to supervisor a subordinate".

### Erez Reuveni

[Erez Reuveni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erez-reuveni-5b796b18/) (15 years at DOJ) represented the US government in [Abrego Garcia v Noem](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc).

The [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/05/us/trump-news-tariffs) that he was put on leave for failing to "follow a directive from [his] superiors".

### Olivia Horton

[Olivia Horton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-horton-a4b858141/) (6 months at DOJ) represented the US government in [Doe v OPM](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69582338/doe-v-office-of-personnel-management/).

Per [a court filing in that case](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276820/gov.uscourts.dcd.276820.34.0.pdf), she resigned from the Department of Justice on March 7, 2025.

Per [an April 6, 2025 court filing in the Abrego Garcia case](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.178258/gov.uscourts.ca4.178258.8.1.pdf), she appears to now be working for Quinn Emanuel.

### Sean Murphy

[Sean Murphy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmurphyjd/) (6 years at DOJ) was an AUSA.

Per [an NPR report](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5330879/trump-justice-doj-prosecutor-resignation-jan-6), he resigned in protest of the direction the DOJ was going.
